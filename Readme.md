# CVAPI Model

## Description
This is an open source project that suggests to provide a model for a CV entity that could bee send via POST request on some HR System endpoint in order to provide the substitution of a manual or a semi manual applicant form filling.

Prepare JSON with info about your developer experience and send it. That's all. No more parsing of a PDF, etc.

Maybe... In a future :)
